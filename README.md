BAGO is a Bayesian optimization strategy for LC gradient optimization for MS-based small molecule analysis. Check out our [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/btNblKBXxk8)

### BAGO enables

**Highly efficient gradient optimization**

- Find an optimal gradient for your LC-MS/MS analysis within 10 runs.
- Wonder why BAGO is efficient? Read more about [acquisition functions](https://bago.readthedocs.io/en/latest/acq-func.html).

**Omics-scale evaluation on compound separation**

- Separation efficiency was defined to evaluate the performance of a gradient.
- Wonder how omics-scale evaluation is achieved? Read more about [encodings](https://bago.readthedocs.io/en/latest/encodings.html).

**Broader discovery of chemical space**

- Expand your discovery of chemical space by improving identification and quantification.

# _bago_ Python package

_bago_ is a Python package for supporting the proposed Bayesian Optimization framework of LC gradient optimization.

_bago_ covers the proposed features needed in creating a gradient optimization workflow based on Bayesian optimization. Depending on your use case, _bago_ can be used in different ways:

- Perform LC gradient optimization in programmtic envrionment
- Model LC-MS experiment to evaluate compound separation performance
- Optimize the default pipeline to adpat a special gradient optimization scenario
- Further development of the proposed Bayesian optimization strategy
- Extend the corrent stategy to other LC-based analytical platforms
