With A Jupyter Notebook
-----------------------

.. meta::
   :description lang=en: Get started optimizing LC gradient with a Jupyter Notebook.

A Jupyter Notebook is provided to help you get started with the LC gradient optimization. 
The notebook is available on GitHub and can be run locally. 

If you want to learn more about how to use Jupyter Notebook, check out `Jupyter Notebook. <http://jupyter.org/>`_.

Set up Jupyter Notebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. seealso:: If you already set up Jupyter Notebook, you can skip to the next section.

Download and install Python 3.8 or later from `python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
``pip`` should be included with Python 3.8 or later. Make sure that the ``pip`` command is 
available from the command line by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip --version

If you have an older version of Python, you can install ``pip`` by following the instructions at `pip installation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`_.

For users new to Python, we recommend using Visual Studio Code to run the notebook. 
Download and install Visual Studio Code from `code.visualstudio.com <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_.

In Visual Studio Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Python: Select Interpreter".
Select the Python 3.8 or later interpreter that you installed in the previous step.

Install Jupyter extensions for Visual Studio Code from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.


Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the ``bago`` package from command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install bago

Download the Jupyter Notebook from `GitHub <https://github.com/Waddlessss/BAGO>`_.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to get started.
